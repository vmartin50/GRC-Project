# NIST 800-171 Automated Compliance Scanner
---
## Project Overview  
This project demostrates **"NIST-as-Code."** It uses a Python-based scanner to automatically audit a Windows system against 10 specific security controls from the **NIST 800-171** framework.

Instead of checking settings by hand, this tool scans the system to provide an instant "Compliant" or "Non-Compliant" report. This bridges the gap between our security goals and our actual settings, verifying that our computer configurations strictly follow our written security requirements.

## Project Structure



This file is written in **Markdown**, a lightweight formatting language used across the tech industry.

## What Is a README?

A README is usually the **first thing someone sees** when they open a project.  
It answers key questions like:

- What is this project?
- How do I use it?
- Why does it exist?
- Who is it for?

Well-written READMEs make projects easier to understand, use, and maintain.

## What Is Markdown?

Markdown is a plain-text language that allows you to add formatting such as:

- Headings
- Lists
- Links
- Code blocks
- Emphasis (bold / italics)

Without using complex tools or word processors.

Markdown files typically end in `.md`, like this one: `README.md`.

## Why Markdown Matters

Markdown is used **everywhere**, including:

- GitHub and GitLab repositories
- Technical documentation
- Security reports
- Open-source projects
- Blogs and knowledge bases

If you work in **IT, cybersecurity, software development, or data**, you *will* encounter Markdown.

Learning it now gives you a real, transferable skill.

## What You Should Practice

As a student, you should practice:

- Editing this file
- Adding your own sections
- Creating lists and headings
- Writing clear explanations in plain language

Try modifying this README to describe **your project**, **your lab**, or **your assignment**.

## Final Thought

Markdown isn’t about making things “look nice” — it’s about **communicating clearly**.

If someone else can understand your work just by reading your README,  
you’re already thinking like a professional.

Good luck, and welcome to Markdown!
