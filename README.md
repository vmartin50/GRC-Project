# NIST 800-171 Automated Compliance Scanner

## Project Overview  
This project demostrates **"NIST-as-Code."** It uses a Python-based scanner to automatically audit a Windows system against 10 specific security controls from the **NIST 800-171** framework.

---

## The Problem
In many organizations, security auditing is a slow, manual process. IT teams often rely on checklists and "best guesses" to determine if their workstations are secure. This leads to:
* **Human Error:** Missing critical settings during manual checks.
* **Lack of Evidence:** No timestamped proof for auditors that a system was actually secure.
* **Consistency Gaps:** Different machines having different security levels

---

## The Solution
Instead of checking settings by hand, this tool scans the system to provide an instant "Compliant" or "Non-Compliant" report. This bridges the gap between our security goals and our actual settings, verifying that our computer configurations strictly follow our written security requirements. 

---

## Project Structure
* **scanner.py**: The core Python program that runs the audit.
*  **control.csv**: The live report generated by the scanner.
*  **policy.md**: The formal written security handbook.

## How to Run
To perform a security audit on a local Windows machine, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Project:** Clone this repository or download the `scanner.py` file.
2. **Open Terminal:** Open PowerShell or Command Prompt (CMD) as an **Administrator**. 
   > *Note: Administrator rights are required to check system-level settings like BitLocker and the Registry.*
3. **Execute the Scanner:**
   ```bash
   python scanner.py
4. **Result:** View the updated `controls.csv` for your status.

## 🔍 The 10 NIST Controls Checked
The scanner verifies the following essential security areas:

### Control Mapping Table
| NIST ID | Security Requirement | Technical Check Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1.9** | **Session Lock** | Registry Key: `ScreenSaveActive` |
| **3.5.3** | **Password Complexity** | Windows `net accounts` policy |
| **3.1.8** | **Limit Login Attempts** | Windows `lockout threshold` |
| **3.5.7** | **Password Reuse** | Password history length check |
| **3.14.2**| **Malware Protection** | Windows Defender Service Status |
| **3.8.3** | **Media Sanitization** | `manage-bde` BitLocker Status |
| **3.1.5** | **Least Privilege** | User SID / Group Membership check |
| **3.5.8** | **Password Encryption** | Registry SAM protection check |
| **3.14.5**| **Update Definitions** | `Get-MpComputerStatus` via PowerShell |
| **3.4.7** | **Software Whitelisting** | `Get-AppLockerPolicy` check |
